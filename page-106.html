    <p>You grit your teeth and run down the stairs. The cat looks up, hissing and glaring at you with hatred. You feel dizzy and weak in the knees, but you run past it down to the hallway, down the main staircase, and then to the kitchen door.</p>
    
    <p>Just as you are about to escape outside, you feel yourself being pulled slowly back as if by some invisible hand. What power can it be that has stopped you in your tracks? You turn and look into a pair of ghostly eyes surrounded by a round gray glow. From its mouthless form you hear this command: “<i>Leave at once. If ever again you look at Chimney Rock, my fate will be your fate</i>.”</p>

    <p>You rush out into the bright sunshine, thankful to be free and resolve never to look back at Chimney Rock!</p>
