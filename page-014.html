    <p>You make your way through the furniture scattered about the room and open the door to the closet. It smells of moth balls and is filled with clothes, some very old, some quite new. You notice a policeman’s uniform, and a large key ring with three keys on it hanging from a nail.</p>

    <p>You are suddenly startled by a squeaky noise. It is only a mouse scurrying across the room. You walk back towards the door. The mouse comes running right at you! You step back, ready to kick it away, but suddenly it rolls over on its side, dead.</p>

    <p>You rush out of the room toward the stairs. Then, as you collect your wits, you remember the keys, and wonder if they might come in handy.</p>
