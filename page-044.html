    <p>You call up to the cat, but it remains immobile, its eyes fixed upon you. You stare back. It returns your gaze without blinking, then arches its back, hisses, and runs off.</p>

    <p>You follow it down a narrow corridor, but lose sight of it as it darts around a corner. Soon you come to a massive oak door. It is locked.</p>

    <p>You try the keys on your key ring. One of them works! You pull open the door and shine your flashlight inside. There are steps leading down. Drawn by curiosity, you cautiously descend the stairs.</p>

    <p>When you reach the bottom, you find yourself in an underground tunnel. Its floor is paved with cobblestones; the walls and ceiling are supported by wooden beams. The air is damp and cold. You follow the tunnel for about a hundred feet before it opens up into a wide space filled with casks and racks of bottles. This must be a special cave where Mr. Bigley kept his wines.</p>

    <p>At the far end of the cave is a chest with three drawers. The top one is locked. You try another one of your keys. It works! You pull open the drawer and take out some yellowed, crumbling papers you find there. Among them is a letter, written in a shaky hand, which reads:</p>

    <p class="letter-salutation"><em>To Whom It May Concern</em></p>

    <p class="letter-content">I, Horace A. Bigley, am a prisoner in my own house, held by the ghost of my wife, Melissa Bigley, who died one month ago today, and now has the power to transform people into&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>
