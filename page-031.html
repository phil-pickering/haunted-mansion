    <p>You grope your way along in the dark, trying to find the swinging door to the kitchen. A hand clutches your arm. You feel like screaming.</p>

    <p>“Help,” a voice calls almost in a whisper.</p>

    <p>“Who are you?” you reply.</p>

    <p>“I’m Lena, Mrs. Bigley’s maid. I was afraid to speak before. I cannot escape without your help.”</p>

    <p>“You can just walk out of the house,” you say.</p>

    <p>“I wish I could, but I can’t. I’m under the curse&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>

    <p>“But can’t Mrs. Bigley help?”</p>

    <p>“<em>Mrs. Bigley?</em> Don’t you understand?”</p>

    <p>Lena bursts into tears. You try to comfort her. Finally, she steadies herself and renews her grip on your sleeve.</p>

    <p>“Please,” she cries. “If you will only carry the cat out of the house, I will be saved. <em>Will you help me?</em>”</p>
