    <p>You pick Melissa up and walk swiftly downstairs and run out of the house. Michael and Jane are waiting in the rear yard. When they see you, they come running. Right behind them is Jervis, the caretaker.</p>

    <p>“I always knew someone would lift the curse,” Jervis says. “You are the one who has done it and I’m the one who will get the reward.”</p>

    <p>Jervis starts to take the cat from you, but it bristles and hisses at him. When he backs away, the cat nestles down again in your arms.</p>

    <p>“Melissa is choosing you as its new owner. She’s yours to keep if you want her,” he says, as he turns abruptly and starts back toward his cottage.</p>

    <p>“Do you think there really is a reward?” Jane asks.</p>

    <p>“If there is, why should Jervis get it?” Michael adds.</p>

    <p>You were wondering the same thing yourself.</p>
