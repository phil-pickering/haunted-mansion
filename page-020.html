    <p>You run back toward the kitchen door. As you go through the study, you see an old woman, dressed all in black. Her face is pale, and her reddish-white hair is swept back in a bun. So this is Mrs. Bigley! She looks so frightening, you would think she is a witch, if witches really existed.</p>

    <p>“How nice it is to have visitors,” she says in a raspy voice. “You’ve been in the house quite a while, haven’t you? I hardly knew where to find you; you’ve been running around as quietly as a mouse. Well, now that you’re here, come with me to the pantry. I have some cheese and crackers I know you will like!”</p>

    <p>“Thanks, but I’m very anxious to help my cousin Jane,” you say. “She’s in the front hall. I’m afraid she is losing her mind. She thinks she is imprisoned by bars. But she really isn’t.”</p>

    <p>“Oh, I can take care of her. Don’t worry,” Mrs. Bigley replies. “Just sit down and enjoy some cheese and crackers and I promise you I’ll find Jane.”</p>
