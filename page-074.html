    <p>You turn back and walk toward the dark part of the hall near the stairs. A thin young woman in a short black dress beckons you over.</p>

    <p>“You must help me,” she whispers. “I’m Mrs. Bigley’s maid, Lena. I can talk to you now because Mrs. Bigley is not watching. I am under a curse. You can save me, but only if&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.” Suddenly, she shrieks.</p>

    <p>You look around and see an old woman with a cane standing nearby. She is slim, like Lena, though much older and much taller. She is slightly stooped, and her head swings around like the head of a snake. Her sharp, green eyes fix on you and then on Lena, who seems to shrivel under the force of her mistress’ gaze. So this is Mrs. Bigley!</p>

    <p>“Look into my eyes,” the old woman says to you.</p>
