    <p>You turn to leave.</p>

    <p>“Block the way, Lena,” Mrs. Bigley shrieks.</p>

    <p>A slim young woman dressed in a short black dress appears in front of you. Although she holds a carving knife, she stares at you with fear in her eyes.</p>

    <p>“I can’t, I can’t, Mrs. Bigley,” she cries. “I can’t anymore—you WITCH!”</p>

    <p>She is screaming now at Mrs. Bigley, and you turn and look at the old woman, who looks even paler and more hateful than before. For a brief moment, you see the image of a black cat in her eyes before they close as she collapses in a heap on the floor. You and Lena bend down and examine her. You lift her wrist to take her pulse, but she seems to be dead.</p>

    <p>“You’ve saved me!” Lena cries. “But, we must get out of here. Follow me!”</p>

    <p>You want to run with her, but you also remember Jane is missing!</p>
