    <p>You walk up to the cupboard and fling open the door. On the shelf in front of your eyes is a stuffed mouse, surrounded by twigs and leaves as if in its natural setting. The mouse is standing with one tiny paw resting on a piece of bark. Your mouth falls open in disbelief when you read the brass plaque next to the mouse on which is inscribed <i>Horace I. Bigley (1921–1979)</i>.</p>

    <p>Bewildered and confused, you stagger out of Chimney Rock. A few minutes later, two more policemen arrive. They search the house, but they are unable to find Jane. You have a sinking feeling you may never see her again.</p>
