    <p>You start down the stairs toward the kitchen, keeping an eye in the direction of the cat. You reach a landing and start to walk along a passageway leading off from it.</p>

    <p>You are wondering whether to continue on, when you hear a muffled voice calling, “Melissa, where are you? <em>Melissa</em>, where are you?”</p>

    <p>Could this be Mrs. Bigley?</p>

    <p>As you cautiously walk along the passageway, you hear the voice speaking again—“It’s time for me to come to you, Melissa.”</p>

    <p>You round the corner and encounter a slim, tall, elderly woman dressed in black. Her face is wrinkled, but her green eyes are sharp. Her nose seems darker than the rest of her face. Her head slopes back, and her reddish-white hair is swept back in a bun. She stares at you with hatred in her eyes, and you stare back, determined not to turn your eyes away. Suddenly, she shrieks and runs down the stairs.</p>

    <p>You follow her down the stairs and stumble through the kitchen and out into the yard. You sit down at the base of a large tree, trying to sort out your thoughts.</p>

    <p>In a few minutes, Jane and Michael join you. They tell you they searched the house but could not find Mrs. Bigley or her cat.</p>

    <p>The next morning, your visit with Jane and Michael is at an end. You have an hour or so before your bus leaves. You walk up the road again to Chimney Rock and stand looking at it for a long time. Then you see the burly, fat-faced caretaker approaching you, his huge dog with him, straining at the leash.</p>

    <p>As he approaches, you get ready to run, but he calls out, “Don’t be afraid. I am your friend. You have freed me from the witch’s curse!”</p>

    <p>“What do you mean? Where is Mrs. Bigley?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“She died, yesterday,” he replies, “for the last time.”</p>
