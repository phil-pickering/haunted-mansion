    <p>“Thanks again,” you say, “but I think I better be going.”</p>

    <p>You get up and start toward the kitchen.</p>

    <p>“Oh, I wouldn’t go that way,” Lena says. “Jervis, the caretaker, is there.”</p>

    <p>“Why should I be afraid of him?” you ask. “He has no right to keep me here.”</p>

For the first time, you notice a portrait on the wall of a tall slender woman, dressed in black and gray and holding a large black cat in her lap.
