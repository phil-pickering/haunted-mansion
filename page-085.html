    <p>You follow Melissa down the hall, around the corner and along a narrow passageway. The dirty, white plaster walls are chipped, and the floor is strewn with bits of plaster and other debris. At the end of the hall is a staircase leading up to an attic. Melissa starts up it and you follow. When you get to the top, she runs between your legs and darts down the stairs again. Before you can even turn around, the door slams shut in front of you. You are locked in.</p>
