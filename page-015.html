    <p>The storeroom is a creepy place; you are glad to be out of it. When you reach the landing, you notice something you hadn’t seen before—a brass ring set in the floor. You tug at the ring, and a square portion of the floor comes up. You pull it wide open, exposing a narrow circular staircase leading to a room below.</p>

    <p>There is just enough light to see by, and you start climbing down the stairs, curious as to where they lead. Suddenly, you hear a crash overhead. The trap door has slammed shut.</p>
