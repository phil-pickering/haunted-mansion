# The Curse of the Haunted Mansion

> WILL YOU UNLOCK THE MYSTERY OF CHIMNEY ROCK?
> 
> On your vacation in Connecticut, you notice a huge empty stone house at the top of a hill. Some of the windows are boarded up. Some are covered with vines. The old house, known as "Chimney Rock," is so dark and gloomy that most people won't go near it.
>
>But you're the curious type. Should you see for yourself what's inside? Your cousin urges you to go ahead.
>
>*If you say, "I'll do it!" turn to p. 4.*
>
>*If you say, "No thanks!" turn to p. 6.*
>
>What happens next in the story? It all depends on the choices *you* make. How does the story end? Only *you* can find out! And the best part is that you can keep reading and rereading until you've had not *one* but *many* incredibly daring experiences!

## About this Project

**The Curse of the Haunted Mansion** is an interactive, web-based version of the gamebook of the same name, written by [Edward Packard](https://www.edwardpackard.com/) and first published in 1980 as one of the early titles in the highly-popular [Choose Your Own Adventure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) series. 

This project is my submission for the [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)' Halloween Event which was held during October 2022.

If you would like to read the gamebook, then it is currently hosted at: https://haunted-mansion.w3spaces.com

In addition, there is also a specially-created playlist on Spotify which you might want to listen to while reading the gamebook: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/41hpTehT3HdPa1LkFE4LTi

## Colophon

The entire text of the original gamebook was typed by hand into Microsoft Word using a scanned copy of the gamebook held by the [Open Library](https://openlibrary.org/works/OL30112W/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure_-_The_Mystery_of_Chimney_Rock) for reference.

The content of the Word document was subsequently marked up with HTML, and then styled with CSS using Notepad.

The project uses [ITC Benguit](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/itc-benguiat), the same typeface employed in the original gamebook, and is available as a web font via [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/).

The color theme was inspired by the Netflix series [Stranger Things](https://www.netflix.com/title/80057281) and built with the help of [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com).

The background paper texture was designed by Merry and is available from [Subtle Patterns](https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/seamless-paper-texture/).

All the HTML and CSS has been validated by the [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and [W3C CSS Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/), respectively.
