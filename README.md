   > On your vacation in Connecticut, you notice a huge empty stone house at the top of a hill. Some of the windows are boarded up. Some are covered with vines. The old house, known as "Chimney Rock," is so dark and gloomy that most people won't go near it.

   >## CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE

When I was growing up in the late 1970s / early 1980s, if I wasn't coding home computer games in BASIC or playing Dungeons & Dragons, you would have probably found me reading a book.

I read lots of different types of books, but my absolute favorite at the time were **gamebooks**. First, the *Choose Your Own Adventure* series that came from the USA, then the more ambitious *Fighting Fantasy* series created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, which incorporated additional role-playing elements from D&D.

About a decade later, while studying literature at University, I learnt that these gamebooks of my childhood were part of a larger, much older genre called **hypertext fiction**, with contributions from such literary greats as James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Vladmir Nabokov, Ayn Rand and John Fowles.

Then a few years later in the mid-1990s, as I gradually worked my way back into computer programming, I was introduced to the World Wide Web and instantly recognized the use of hypertext to link documents together allowing the reader to "choose their own adventure" in cyberspace.

Straight away I thought that this new publishing medium would be the ideal platform for gamebooks, but instead of exploring the idea further, I filed it away somewhere in my head, with a promise that I would get around to implementing it one day.

Well, I didn't think it was going to take me over 25 years to get round to it, but I'm so happy that I finally put a very old idea into action with this project.

*The Curse of the Haunted Mansion* was first published in 1980 (under the original, much-less-snappier title of *"The Curse of Chimney Rock"*). It was the fifth book in the highly-successful series of *Choose Your Own Adventure* books - over 180 different books were published in total. Many of these books have unfortunately been out-of-print for over 25 years, including *"The Curse of the Haunted Mansion"*, so I hope that the author of the book, and creator of the series, Edward Packard, and the original publisher, Bantam Books, don't mind too much if I temporarily resurrect this classic ghost story for the W3Schools Community Halloween Event.
