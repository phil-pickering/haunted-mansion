   >## CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE

When I was growing up in the late 1970s / early 1980s, if I wasn't coding home computer games in BASIC or playing Dungeons & Dragons, you would have probably found me reading a book.

I read lots of different types of books, but my absolute favorite at the time were **gamebooks**. First, the *Choose Your Own Adventure* series that came from the USA, then the more ambitious *Fighting Fantasy* series created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, which incorporated additional role-playing elements from D&D.

About a decade later, while studying literature at University, I learnt that these gamebooks of my childhood were part of a larger, much older genre called **hypertext fiction**, with contributions from such literary greats as James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Vladmir Nabokov, Ayn Rand and John Fowles.

Then a few years later in the mid-1990s, as I gradually found myself moving back into computer programming, I was introduced to the World Wide Web and instantly recognized the use of hypertext to link documents together allowing the reader to "choose their own adventure" in cyberspace.

Straight away I thought that this new publishing medium would be the ideal platform for gamebooks, but instead of exploring the idea further, I filed it away somewhere in my head, with a promise that I would get around to implementing it one day.

Well, I didn't think it was going to take me over 25 years to get round to it, but I'm so happy that I finally put a very old idea into action with this project.

*The Curse of the Haunted Mansion* was first published in 1980 (under the original, much-less-snappier title of *"The Curse of Chimney Rock"*). It was the fifth book in the highly-successful series of *Choose Your Own Adventure* books - over 180 different books were published in total. Many of these books have unfortunately been out-of-print for over 25 years, including *"The Curse of the Haunted Mansion"*, so I hope that the author of the book, and creator of the series, Edward Packard, and the original publisher, Bantam Books, don't mind too much if I temporarily resurrect this classic ghost story for the W3Schools' Community Halloween Event.

The only access I had to the original story was from the scanned pages of the copy held in the online Open Library. That meant I had to type the whole book out in Word (over 15,000 words) before I could start coding. While this took quite a bit of time, it gave me a really good insight into how the book was structured, how each line is impeccably punctuated, and it also gave me ample time to think carefully about how I would go about marking up the content with HTML and then styling it with CSS.

To save time with the HTML (there were over 100 pages that needed marking up), I carefully put together a template which contained all the markup that was common to every single page. I then inserted the relevant content for each page into the template, along with the links for each page, plus added a few extra HTML elements on those pages that required some additional markup. Page 119 was particularly challenging, as you'll find out if you choose the path that leads to that ending!

When it came to styling the pages, I tried to be as faithful to the original book as possible, from the ITC Benguit typeface (which will be familiar to Stranger Things fans), the line length and height, the basic layout, to the color palette. I also retained the book-based language (e.g. "Turn to page 44.") as I want the reader to feel as if they are reading the original book and help them become immersed in the story, not just simply clicking or tapping functionally-named buttons.

And like all great pop-culture themed projects from the 1980s, this project comes with its own mixtape (tip of the hat to Star Lord) which I've specially put together on Spotify. It's just under 45 minutes long (so it would fit on one side of a C90 cassette tape), and all the songs (bar one) were released in 1980. From synthpop to punk, rock to rockabilly, disco to funk, it's the perfect background soundtrack to read along to. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did collating it.
