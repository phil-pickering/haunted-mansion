   >## CHOOSE YOUR OWN ADVENTURE

When I was growing up in the late 1970s / early 1980s, if I wasn't coding home computer games in BASIC or playing Dungeons & Dragons, you would have probably found me reading a book.

I read lots of different types of books, but my absolute favorite at the time were **gamebooks**. First, the *Choose Your Own Adventure* series that came from the USA, then the more ambitious *Fighting Fantasy* series created by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone, which incorporated role-playing elements from D&D.

About a decade later, while studying literature at University, I learnt that these gamebooks of my childhood were part of a larger, much older genre called **hypertext fiction**, with contributions from such literary greats as James Joyce, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Vladmir Nabokov, Ayn Rand and John Fowles.

Then a few years later in the mid-1990s, as I gradually worked my way back into computer programming, I was introduced to the World Wide Web and instantly recognized the use of hypertext to link documents together allowing the reader to "choose their own adventure" in cyberspace.

Straight away I thought that this new publishing medium would be an ideal platform for gamebooks but instead of exploring the idea further, I filed it away somewhere in my head, with a promise that I would get around to implementing it one day.

Well, I didn't think it was going to take me over 25 years to get round to it, but I'm so happy that I did finally put a very old idea into action with this project.
