    <p>You let Melissa down and shoo her away. She looks up reproachfully and scampers off into the woods. You and your cousins head back to their house.</p>

    <p>That evening you ask your aunt and uncle whether they have heard anything about a reward for ending the curse of Chimney Rock. Your uncle laughs at the idea, but he says that if anyone knows, it would be the Bigley’s family lawyer, Gilliam Prem.</p>
