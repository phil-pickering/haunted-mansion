    <p>When you call out, there is no answer. You start upstairs. Somehow you feel that the person you heard is very close. Halfway up the stairs, you begin to feel dizzy. You return downstairs and enter the study, but at once the whole room is whirling around your head. In a moment you feel yourself losing consciousness.</p>

    <p>When you awaken sometime later, you notice that the sun has set and it is beginning to get dark.</p>
