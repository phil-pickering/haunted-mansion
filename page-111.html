    <p>“I’m going to find out what he’s talking about,” you say to your cousins, and you let Melissa down and walk toward the cottage. Michael and Jane follow.</p>

    <p>For a while your knocking goes unanswered, but finally Jervis opens the door. At first he doesn’t seem anxious to talk to you, but, when you persist in your questioning, he explains that he was promised a reward if he would live in the cottage and take care of the cat until it chose a new owner.</p>

    <p>“You ended the curse. But don’t think you’re going to get any of the reward,” he shouts, as he slams the door in your face.</p>

    <p>The three of you search for Melissa, but she is nowhere to be seen. It’s getting late, so you start home, pausing just long enough to take a last look back at Chimney Rock. But when you do, there is nothing to be seen except a meadow filled with wild flowers. The curse of Chimney Rock itself was no more than a dream!</p>

    <p>But what is not a dream is the large black cat, walking toward you out of the meadow, then brushing up against your legs, as if to announce that you are its new owner—for better or for worse.</p>
