    <p>Vacation is here and you’re visiting your cousins Michael and Jane for a few days at their new home in Connecticut. Soon after you arrive, they take you on a tour of their neighborhood, along shady streets lined with cozy houses with neatly-trimmed lawns. At the top of a hill you notice a huge stone house unlike any you have ever seen. It has turrets, walled terraces and a square tower that looks like a giant chimney. Some of the windows are boarded up and others are hidden by vines and bushes. There is a big dog chained in front of the little cottage nearby, and you ask your cousins if anyone live in the main house.</p>

    <p>“Chimney Rock? Most people around here wouldn’t live there for a million dollars,” Michael says.</p>

    <p>“It’s supposed to be cursed,” Jane adds. “They say that some people who have gone inside have never been seen again. What happened to them is still a mystery.”</p>
