    <p>You walk along a passageway that leads to a large hall. The floor is covered with oriental rugs, and the walls are lined with antique oil paintings. A grandfather clock slowly ticks the minutes away, its long brass pendulum swinging back and forth.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, a voice from upstairs shatters the silence. “Melissa, Melissa!”</p>

    <p>You start up the stairs, determined to find out who it is. When you reach the top, everything is silent. Then you hear a cough from one of the bedrooms. The door is ajar. You look in and see a very old woman, sitting in a rocking chair, knitting.</p>

    <p>“Come in, come in,” she calls in a cheery voice.</p>

    <p>“Are you Mrs. Bigley?” you ask.</p>

    <p>The woman smiles and laughs. “No, No,” she says. “I’m her sister, Mrs. Krim; Mrs. Bigley is my cat.”</p>
