    <p>Before you can finish reading the note, you feel a presence. You whirl your flashlight around but it goes out. In the final, flickering light, you see a figure and, even now in the dark, you can feel its eyes fixed upon you. You reach for the rack of wine bottles and pull one out. It may be of no use against a ghost, but it is your only weapon.</p>
