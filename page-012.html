    <p>Almost as soon as you step inside the house, you hear a muffled cry for help. It’s Jane! Following the sound of her voice, you run through the kitchen, fling open the swinging door to the dining room, and make your way through the dark, musty library and into the front hall. You find her there, huddled behind the grand staircase.</p>

    <p>“What happened? Are you all right?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“If only you can help me!” she cries. “I’m trapped.”</p>

    <p>“Trapped?”</p>

    <p>“Yes! I was looking around the house and I found a cat sitting right where we are now—it must be Melissa—and I went up to pat her, but she gave me a terrible look; she seemed to be laughing at me. Then she began pacing back and forth—as if there were bars there between us. Finally, she went away, but <em>I feel as if the bars are still there</em>, and that if I try to go through them something terrible will happen.”</p>

    <p>You are unable to convince Jane that she has nothing to fear.</p>
