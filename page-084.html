    <p>You lunge forward and swing the wine bottle, striking something. The bottle breaks, and wine splatters all over you. A voice cries out—it’s Michael. He screams.</p>

    <p>“It’s me!” you cry. “I’m sorry. I thought you were going to get me.”</p>

    <p>You shine your light on Michael’s head. Fortunately, he seems not to be injured.</p>

    <p>“Follow me closely,” you say. “We’ll get out of here.”</p>

    <p>Suddenly, you hear a roaring sound. Clouds of dust rise around you. Loose dirt scatters down around you. You shine your light toward the tunnel; it is blocked off, but there is light coming through from above. Suddenly, the roof of the tunnel is caving in. You are being buried alive!</p>

    <p>“Don’t worry,” a voice calls down. “I’m a policeman! I’ve radioed for help. We’ll have you out of there soon.”</p>

    <p>But even as you hear his words, you are gasping your last breath, another victim of the curse of Chimney Rock.</p>
