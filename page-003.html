    <p>“You see,” Michael exclaims, “Mrs. Bigley lived in Chimney Rock alone with her cat for many years. When she died, she left instructions in her will that the cat could live there for the rest of its life. People say that she put a curse on the house so that no one would bother the cat.”</p>

    <p>“Haven’t the police investigated?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“The police never found anyone—only the cat,” Michael says, “but some people say Mrs. Bigley never died at all—and that she’s still living there herself!”</p>

    <p>“What does the caretaker say?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“He doesn’t say anything,” Michael replies. “Some say he’s crazy, and some say he’s just mean, but I guess he’s afraid of the curse too, because I hear he wont set foot inside Chimney Rock.”</p>

    <p>“You’re not kidding?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“If you think we’re kidding,” Michael says, “why don’t <em>you</em> go inside?”</p>
