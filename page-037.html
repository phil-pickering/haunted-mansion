    <p>You go into the pantry with Mrs. Bigley. Some crackers and cheese are already on the table. You decide to eat one cracker and no more. As soon as you take your first bite, you feel dizzy.</p>

    <p>Your vision is blurred, but, as well as you can tell, everything around you looks as if it is growing in size. The fuzzy outline of Mrs. Bigley seems to tower above you. You wonder if you have been poisoned, but you can’t think straight.</p>

    <p>You jump down from your chair and run as fast as you can out of the dining room and into the study. You hear sounds behind you. Mrs. Bigley must be chasing you. You dare not look back. For an instant, you realize you should not be afraid of an old woman, but you <em>are</em> afraid.</p>

    <p>Ahead of you is a small passageway you didn’t notice before. It looks almost like a tunnel—an escape route. You scamper inside. You have to crawl, but gradually it seems to get larger, much larger, so that you can almost stand up. Suddenly you realize that your surroundings have not been getting larger; you have been getting smaller—much, much smaller! You try to stand up, but you can’t seem to keep your balance, <em>standing on your hind legs</em>. You try to cry out, but your brain can only think—<em>run, eat, hide,</em>—like the mouse you are.</p>
