    <p>“I’ll help,” you say. “Do you know where we can find the cat?”</p>

    <p>“It’s upstairs. Follow me,” she says. “But stay close behind. When we meet the cat, grab it. You have the power.”</p>

    <p>You follow Lena upstairs and through the upper hall to a room in the back of the house. The room contains a sewing machine, a loom and a table. There is also an armchair with a flower-print slip cover. On it, sound asleep, is a large black cat.</p>

    <p>You pick up the cat and walk swiftly down the steps through the interior rooms and out the kitchen door. The cat tries to scratch you and jump out of your arms, but you hold it tightly. Lena throws open the door, and you step outside into the bright sunlight. The cat begins to purr.</p>

    <p>Lena dances in the air. “The spell is broken!” she cries. “You’ve saved me!”</p>

    <p>Michael and Jane come running up. They are surprised to see you with Lena and the cat. No one notices the heavyset man walking toward you until he is almost upon you. It is Jervis, the caretaker. Everyone looks at him anxiously, but he smiles broadly.</p>

    <p>“I always knew that someone would lift the curse, and you have done it,” he says. “I thank you from the bottom of my heart.”</p>

    <p>“Ended the curse? How? Where is Mrs. Bigley?” you ask Jervis.</p>

    <p>“Don’t you understand?” he replies. “You’re holding her in your arms. She has turned herself into a cat—this time for good!”</p>
