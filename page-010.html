    <p>You walk through the swinging door and into an elegant dining room. A splendid crystal chandelier hangs over the long oak table. Double bay windows are partly hidden by dark green, satin curtains. A bottle of wine rests on a silver tray on the sideboard. Next to it is a bright green china cat.</p>
    
    <p>You sit down at the table and ponder the situation. There is a small, brass bell within reach, and on impulse, you ring it.</p>

    <p>Within a few moments, a door you hadn’t noticed before opens, and a thin, young woman walks in. She is wearing a black dress and a little white hat in the fashion of a maid.</p>

    <p>“Oh,” she says, looking at you with surprise, “I didn’t know Mrs. Bigley was expecting a guest today. I’m Lena. May I bring you anything? Perhaps cheese and crackers—you must be hungry.”</p>
