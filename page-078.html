    <p>Making sure you keep out of sight of the caretaker’s cottage, you run back to the house and look in the windows, hoping to see someone inside.</p>

    <p>As you are standing there, you hear a dog growling nearby. You turn and see Jervis’ mastiff standing a few feet away, staring at you. It steps forward slowly, growling and showing its teeth. Now it is close enough to spring.</p>

    <p>At that moment, a police car roars up the drive. Michael and a policeman jump out. The dog backs off and starts barking at the policeman, who takes out his gun and fires a shot in the air. Jervis, the caretaker, comes running up. When he spots the policeman, he calls off his dog.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, you hear a crash. Jane has broken a window in the living room. She jumps out into a juniper bush.
The policeman walks up and stands looking at her for a long time.</p>

    <p>“If this were an ordinary house,” he says, “I’d arrest you for breaking and entering. But this is Chimney Rock. I’m glad you got out alive.”</p>
