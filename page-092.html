    <p>You dart past Lena and run to the part of the dining room facing the front of the house. You unlatch a window and try to raise it, but it is hopelessly jammed. You try another. You shake the next window as hard as you can but your hand slips and goes through the glass. Your hand is slashed. Now you are desperate. You pick up a small, ladderback chair and use it to pound at the window, determined to knock out the wooden crosspieces so you can escape. Your movements increase your bleeding, and you begin to feel faint.</p>

    <p>You call for help through the broken window. With a final effort, you knock out the crosspieces, scramble up onto the windowsill and leap out into the juniper bushes below.</p>

    <p>Michael and Jane come running up. Michael rips off his shirt and bandages your arm. They help you back to their house and call an ambulance to take you to the hospital.</p>

    <p>Later, standing at your bedside, your doctor says—“You will always have a scar by which to remember the curse of Chimney Rock.”</p>
