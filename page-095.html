    <p>You climb the main staircase. After exploring the hallways, you find the spiral stairs leading up to the tower. You run up, whirling around and around the center pole so fast that you are almost dizzy by the time you reach the top of the tower—a small, square room with large windows on each side. You have a fine view of the grounds, the road and the surrounding countryside.</p>

    <p>There is no sign of Jane, but you watch with interest as a police car pulls up next to the one already there. A moment later, you see Jane, Michael, and the first policeman running. Even from the tower, you can see they are very agitated. Jane stumbles, and the policeman helps her into the car. Michael stands, looking up at the house, a blank look on his face. Then the second policeman guides Michael into the car, and they drive away.</p>

    <p>You are glad your friends are safe, but you are frightened. You want to leave Chimney Rock as quickly as possible. As you start climbing down the spiral staircase, you hear the meowing of a cat, at first distant, then closer, coming up the stairs.</p>
