    <p>You close your eyes and open them again. You cannot tell if you are awake or asleep. You are sitting on an enormous oriental rug. Before you are cliffs of wood, lined with enormous books. Tables and chairs tower above your head. Are you dreaming? Perhaps you are, for you feel very, very small.</p>

    <p>In the distance, you see a great black cat walking toward you, one slow step at a time.</p>
