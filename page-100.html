    <p>“But I thought Mrs. Bigley was a person, not a cat,” you exclaim.</p>

    <p>“Indeed she is a person,” Mrs. Krim says cheerfully, “when she is not a cat.”</p>

    <p>“A witch!” you exclaim.</p>

    <p>She beckons you closer.</p>

    <p>“You are young,” she says, “and I am old. You must understand that there are things that people don’t talk about, so you never learn about them except through experience—sometimes through horrible experience.”</p>

She began to act more and more like a cat—and even to look like a cat. Then one day&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.”</p>
