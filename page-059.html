    <p>“Look,” you say, “you need not be afraid of Mrs. Bigley. You are a prisoner of your own fears. If you can summon the will to get out of here, you can free yourself.”</p>

    <p>But Lena holds her hands over her face and sobs. When you try to comfort her, she leaps to her feet and runs toward the front door. You follow closely behind.</p>

    <p>Then, as you watch in horror, she seems to freeze for a moment. Her face turns deathly white, and she collapses on the floor. You rush to help her, but it is too late. She is dead.</p>

    <p>Still dizzy, you open the front door. The bright sunshine and cool fresh breeze quickly revive you. You are sad for Lena, but thankful that you have escaped the curse of Chimney Rock.</p>
