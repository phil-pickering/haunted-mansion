    <p>You walk back toward the stairs and turn down another hall leading to some bedrooms, the furthest of which may connect to the music room. At the end of the hall is a large mirror in an ornate gold frame. As you approach it, you see your own reflection and, behind it, the silhouette of a tall, elderly woman dressed in black. Even in the dim light, you can see her burning, green eyes fixed on you. They seem to pin you to your place with a power so strong that you cannot move. You stand helplessly as she walks toward you. You know you must force yourself to act.</p>
