    <p>As you start toward the dining room, you hear a loud pounding on the back door. You run to the kitchen in time to see a burly, red-faced policeman come charging in. Michael is right behind him.</p>

    <p>“I’m glad you’re here,” you cry out. “We need help. Jane is missing!”</p>

    <p>The policeman seems to be looking beyond you. You turn and see Mrs. Bigley glaring at you.</p>

    <p>“How lovely to have so many guests,” she says in a phony, sweet voice.</p>

    <p>“Yes, but where is Jane?” you ask. “I’ve looked everywhere upstairs and I can’t find her.”</p>

    <p>“She must have gone outside for some fresh air,” Mrs. Bigley says sweetly.</p>

    <p>You do not trust Mrs. Bigley, and you ask the policeman to search upstairs. He obliges you, scurrying everywhere, calling for Jane in a bellowing voice, but without success. By the time he rejoins you, he is angry.</p>

    <p>“I’m sure Jane left, and I’m leaving too,” he says, as he hurries for the door. Is he leaving in a rush because <em>he</em> is afraid of the curse?</p>
