    <p>You climb up the stairs and push against the trap door. It won’t budge. You push again, with all your might. Suddenly, the door flies open. You quickly climb out and find yourself looking into the burning, green eyes of a black cat—Melissa! Startled by your appearance, she arches her back and hisses, then leaps at you, claws extended. You reel back and she scampers off.</p>

    <p>You follow her quickly through the kitchen and into the dining room where you lose sight of her. Then you hear the voice of an old woman calling, in a cackling voice, “Melissa, where are you?”</p>
