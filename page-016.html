    <p>You really are hungry and thank Lena for the offer, but ask if she has anything else besides cheese and crackers. Smiling, she goes out and returns a moment later with some delicious-looking brownies. You pick one up and take a very small bite. It tastes even better than it looks, and you can’t resist eating it all.</p>

    <p>In a moment your eyes become blurry. You feel as if you have been drugged. You ring the bell, but Lena does not return. You get up and start toward the door, but you feel yourself falling.</p>

    <p>Sometime later you awaken, feeling weak and confused. It is pitch dark.</p>
