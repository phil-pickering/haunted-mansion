    <p>You summon up your strength. Clinging tightly as you climb, you manage to pull yourself up to the second story balcony. You climb over the railing and step on to a small porch.</p>

    <p>Looking through a window, you observe a mouse scurrying around on the bare wood floor.</p>

    <p>You find the window unlocked. It opens easily and you could climb right in. Yet your hands feel clammy; your heart is pounding. As you lift the window open, you sense an evil presence within the room.</p>
