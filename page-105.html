    <p>You wait anxiously, trying to think of some way to get out. Every once in a while, you call for help. Finally, you hear an answering voice that sounds almost next to you and yet far away at the same time. You grope around and feel a metal surface. You realize you are holding on to the end of a coal chute.</p>

    <p>“Help!” you yell up the chute. In a moment, a voice answers. It’s Michael! You take hold of the chute and work your way in. You find you can climb it. At the top is a thin wooden door. You push it open and climb into a back entryway to the house.</p>

    <p>“I’m glad <em>you’re</em> not a ghost!” Michael says when he sees you.</p>

    <p>“I’m glad too,” you reply. “Just the same, I don’t plan to return to Chimney Rock—ever!”</p>
