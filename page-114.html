    <p>The next morning, after a long wait, you are admitted to the musty office of Gilliam Prem, Esquire.</p>

    <p>You tell him everything that happened and when you finish, ask whether there is a reward for ending the curse of Chimney Rock.</p>

    <p>Mr. Prem tilts back in his black leather chair and puffs on his pipe before replying.</p>

    <p>“Well,” he finally says, “it’s true I told Jervis that he would get a reward of $1,000 if he stayed in the cottage and fed the cat until it died or chose a new owner. I have been following the instructions in Mrs. Bigley’s will. But there is another reward Jervis doesn’t know about: Mrs. Bigley’s will also provides that if the cat chooses a new owner, <em>who is willing to take the cat</em>, then that person will become the owner of the cat—and of Chimney Rock.”</p>

    <p>“By the way, you may not realize it,” Mr. Prem continues, “but now that the curse is ended, Chimney Rock is worth a quarter of a million dollars!”</p>

    <p>Suddenly, you realize that, if you had not let Melissa go, that’s how much <em>you</em> would be worth!</p>
