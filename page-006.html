    <p>When you say “no thanks,” Michael replies, “Well, I don’t blame you.”<p>

    <p>“I’ll go in,” Jane says, “even if you two are afraid, but only on one condition! That you’ll come after me if I don’t come out within five minutes.”</p>

    <p>You and Michael can hardly refuse, so the three of you walk up the road to Chimney Rock. There is no sign of the caretaker or anyone else. You circle the house, trying all the doors. Jane finds one that is unlocked. While you and Michael watch, she opens it and walks inside.</p>

    <p>You suspect that Jane is standing just inside the door and will come out when the five minutes are up. But five, then six and then seven minutes go by. You exchange worried glances with Michael.</p>
    
    <p>“I guess we better go in after her,” you say.</p>

    <p>“I’m going to get help,” he replies. “You stand watch.”</p>

    <p>Before you can answer, he goes running off toward the road.</p>
