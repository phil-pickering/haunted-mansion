    <p>You turn and try to run past Mrs. Bigley. But you feel yourself falling. You look toward her as you try to regain your balance. You can’t take your eyes off her. Your head hits the woodwork, not hard, but hard enough to make you dizzy. You can hardly keep your balance again, but you start to run down the stairs toward the front door.</p>
