    <p>You soon fall asleep again. When you awaken, the house is darker than the day before. It is raining outdoors. You are anxious to get out, and you run to the kitchen door. You pull it open, only to find the entry blocked by the huge figure of Jervis, the caretaker.</p>

    <p>“You’re a brave one, coming in here,” he says.</p>

    <p>“So I’ve learned. I think someone drugged me,” you reply.</p>

    <p>Jervis laughs menacingly. He holds his arm across the door, blocking you from getting past.</p>

    <p>“Drugged, you say,” he says. “You’d be lucky if that’s all it were.”</p>

    <p>“What do you mean?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“You’ve not been drugged. You are <em>possessed</em>—possessed by the cat devil. Your only chance is to stare down the cat till it gives in, or you will be cursed the rest of your life.”</p>

    <p>“Why should I believe such a story?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“Can’t you see,” Jervis says, pressing in so close that you take a step backward, “<em>I’m</em> cursed.” Then in a calmer tone he says—“The maid you saw—<em>she’s</em> been cursed, too!”</p>

    <p>Jervis talks so earnestly that you begin to think there could be something to what he says.</p>
