    <p>As you approach the door to the music room, the sounds change. You hear a jumble of notes, as if a small child were banging on the keyboard.</p>

    <p>You pause a moment. The door is slightly ajar. Instead of knocking, you look through the crack with one eye.</p>

    <p>In the middle of the room is a grand piano, made of ebony and inlaid with gold. A large, black cat is walking back and forth on the keys. It must be Melissa.</p>

    <p>Sensing your presence, the cat stops and stares intently at the crack in the door. You cannot be sure whether or not it knows you are watching it.</p>

    <p>There is no sign of anyone in the room. Whoever was playing the piano must have left.</p>
