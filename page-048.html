    <p>You run quickly through the dining room, through the large musty library, and on to the huge living-room hall. Suddenly, you hear a noise from the dining room. You race up the main staircase and stand in the upstairs hall, listening.</p>

    <p>Thump, thump, thump. You hear footsteps following you up the stairs. Yet when you look toward the stairs, there is no one there.</p>

    <p>Now you are aware of the thumping of your heart. Perhaps that’s what you heard: or was it something else? The ghost of Mr. Bigley&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. But, of course ghosts do not exist! Then you hear the thumping sound again, this time from down the hall.</p>

    <p>Across the hall, you notice a large, cedar closet. Further down, you see a door slowly opening.</p>
