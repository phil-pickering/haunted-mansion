    <p>Before Jane realizes what you are doing, you pull her through the imaginary bars.</p>

    <p>“Melissa must have put a spell on me,” she says.</p>

    <p>“Just a little spell,” you reply. “Let’s find that cat. We’ll end its curse on Chimney Rock.”</p>

    <p>At that moment, you hear a meowing from the top of the stairs. The two of you run up to the top landing.</p>

    <p>“You look to the right and I’ll go left,” Jane says.</p>

    <p>There is no sign of the cat in the hall, so you look into a bedroom with its door open. Still no luck. You run to the other hall to see how Jane is doing, but she’s nowhere in sight. You call out to her. You open every door that is not locked and look inside, but she does not answer. You walk back toward the stairs and jump with a start as a mouse runs past; then hurry on for a few steps&#160;.&#160;.&#160;.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, standing before you, is a tall, elderly woman dressed in black, her hair swept back in a bun. Her burning green eyes seem to stare right through you.</p>

    <p>So this is Mrs. Bigley! She never died after all. She looks like a witch! But of course witches don’t really exist. Or do they?</p>
