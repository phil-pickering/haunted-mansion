    <p>“It’s me—Michael,” the voice replies.</p>

    <p>You are both relieved that the other is not a ghost. Your flashlight flickers on and off.</p>

    <p>“My flashlight is getting weaker, and it wasn’t very bright to begin with,” you say. “Let’s get out of here!”</p>

    <p>You shake your flashlight and it flickers on. As you lead the way through the passageway, you hear a roaring sound. The tunnel is caving in behind you. You and Michael are soon covered with dust. Coughing and gasping, you make it back into the house and, finally, out into the fresh air.</p>

    <p>Once outside, you almost stumble on Jane, who is lying near the door, clutching her ankle, grimacing with pain.</p>

    <p>“I fell trying to climb down the vine,” she says. “I twisted my ankle.”</p>

    <p>Only then you notice a policeman has arrived.</p>
