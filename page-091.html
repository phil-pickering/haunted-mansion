    <p>You walk to the slowly opening door. As it opens wide, you feel a blast of air. You look inside. The window is broken. A strong breeze is blowing in.</p>

    <p>When you realize it was only the wind that opened the door, you laugh out loud, but stop abruptly as you hear a cry from the hall. You step through the doorway. There before you, lying on the floor, clutching at his chest, is a policeman!</p>

    <p>“<em>My heart</em>,” he cries.</p>

    <p>A moment later, he is dead. A few feet away at the top of the stairs, Michael is standing, open-mouthed.</p>

    <p>“It was <em>you</em>,” he says. “I thought it was a ghost! And I guess the policeman did too.”</p>
