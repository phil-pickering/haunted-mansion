You see no one, but you feel a strong draft of air. The door to your closet slams shut. You try to open it, but you are locked in. You yell for help, but beyond the double-thick walls of the cedar closet, your voice sounds like nothing more than the moaning of the wind.</p>

    <p>It is a big closet—with enough air to last you two or three hours.</p>
