    <p>You and Lena run through the dining room, then through the kitchen, eager to get out, but as you reach the back door, your way is blocked by a burly, red-faced policeman. Michael is standing behind him.</p>

    <p>“The curse is ended!” Lena cries.</p>

    <p>“Help me rescue Jane!” you call to Michael.</p>

    <p>“Jane is safe and on her way here,” Michael says. “We found her upstairs!”</p>

    <p>You tell everyone about Mrs. Bigley, and the policeman goes to find her. In a few minutes, he returns.</p>

    <p>“I found her, all right,” he says. “But she’s no longer alive—a heart attack, I would say. The poor old woman has fallen victim to the curse of Chimney Rock.”</p>

    <p>“No, officer, you don’t understand,” Lena says. “Mrs. Bigley was a witch. Only her death could <em>end</em> the curse!”</p>
