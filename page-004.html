    <p>“I’ll do it,” you say.</p>

    <p>“OK,” Michael replies. “When are you going? Jane and I will watch you.”</p>

    <p>“We’ll want to say good-by to you,” Jane says.</p>

    <p>You take time to get a flashlight from the house, and then the three of you set off for Chimney Rock. You feel a bit nervous, but it’s a beautiful day, and you keep telling yourself there is really nothing to worry about.</p>

    <p>As you approach it, the house looks bleak and forbidding, like some medieval fortress. A dark cloud passes in front of the sun. The wind blows dust in your eyes. You wish you hadn’t agreed to go inside. But it’s too late to back out now, so while Michael and Jane watch from a distance, you walk around the house and try all the doors. Every one of them is locked except for one in the back of the house. You wave to your cousins, open the door and walk into an entryway that leads to a large kitchen. There are rows of sinks and counters and a huge black oven. The floor is laid with dark red tiles, many of them chipped or loose. The windows are covered with cloth shades, and you raise one of them to let in more light.</p>

    <p>On your right is a flight of steps leading from the kitchen upstairs; to the left is a swinging door, which you imagine leads to the dining room.</p>
