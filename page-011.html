    <p>While you are waiting for Michael, you walk around the house, tapping on the windows and doors. They are locked—even the back door through which Jane entered. She must be imprisoned inside.</p>

    <p>You see Jervis, the caretaker, going into his cottage. Maybe he will help you.</p>

    <p>But there is another possibility. There is a thick vine wrapped around a pillar that supports a balcony over the side porch. It looks as though you could climb it and perhaps get into the house through the windows off the balcony.</p>
