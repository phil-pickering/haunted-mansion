    <p>You run down the stairs and enter the library, where you almost collide with a slim, young woman in a black dress with white lace and a little white hat.</p>

    <p>“You gave me such a start,” she says.</p>

    <p>“I’m sorry about that,” you reply, “but I’m trying to find my cousin Jane. Who are you?”</p>

    <p>“My name is Lena. I am Mrs. Bigley’s maid. Do you know that there is a policeman outside? I just saw him through the window. There is a boy with him. He’ll be coming in the back door. I must let him in.”</p>

    <p>“Yes, he’ll help me find Jane,” you say.</p>

    <p>“He will never be able to help you. You must stay out of sight. That is your only chance.”</p>

    <p>Lena seems to make no sense; yet somehow you feel she is speaking the truth.</p>
