    <p>You hurriedly climb the two flights of stairs to the attic. It is empty except for a large cardboard box containing a few old books and letters. One book strikes your eye. It is titled <cite>The Curse of Chimney Rock</cite>.</p>

    <p>You open it and start to read. The book starts by explaining that the first owner, Elizabeth Bigley, was struck by lightning. Her son, Charles Bigley, was killed when he fell off the roof. His daughter, Melissa, “mysteriously disappeared.”</p>

    <p>You look up from the book for a moment, wondering what happens to people who “mysteriously disappear.” Suddenly you sense that the whole attic and everything in it is growing much larger, but in an instant you realize that it is you who are shrinking. You are dimly aware that no one will ever see you again.</p>
