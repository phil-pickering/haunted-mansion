    <p>You duck and try to get past Jervis, but he pushes you back inside and slams the door shut in your face. You hear a click as he locks you in.</p>

    <p>“Don’t try to get out through a window,” he calls. “I’ll let the dogs loose on you!”</p>

    <p>“You’ll get in plenty of trouble for this!” you cry.</p>

    <p>“I’m doin’ it for your own good!” he shouts back.</p>

    <p>You wonder what to do next. It looks as if you better wait a while before trying to get out. In the meantime, you might as well explore further by going up the back stairs.</p>
