    <p>You follow the cat across a large living room and hall, then up a circular staircase to the high-peaked gable on the west side of the house.</p>

    <p>There is a door near the top of the stairs. The cat runs through it, and you follow. By the light coming through a high, triangular window under the peak of the gable, you can see a human figure huddled in the corner. It is Jane! As you run toward her, the door shuts behind you, and you hear a latch click. You try to pull it open, but it is locked!</p>

    <p>You look around for the cat. It is gone. You bend over Jane, who is crying.</p>

    <p>Is the cat trained to do this trick? You are certain that you and Jane are both in danger. You cry out, but there is no answer.</p>

    <p>Hours go by. Every few minutes the two of you yell for help pound on the door. When darkness falls, you are both still sitting helplessly, wondering if you will ever be rescued.</p>

    <p>Finally, you sleep. When you awaken, the room seems enormous. It is entirely empty, except, a few yards away, sleeping quietly, is a mouse, the same size as you.</p>
