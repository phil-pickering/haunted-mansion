    <p>As you pass through the library in your search for Jane, you are surprised to feel a cold draft of air coming from the great stone fireplace. With its opening framed by huge rough stones, it looks like the entrance to a cavern. You walk up close and stare into the cold, black depths of the great chimney. You are about to turn away when you are startled by a long low moaning sound. Is it just the wind or is it a human cry? Could it be Jane, somehow trapped inside? You crouch and crane your neck to see. The air feels cold and damp. You shiver a moment, and at that moment a hand clutches your shoulder from behind. You whirl around to face your attacker; but it is Jane!</p>

    <p>“I couldn’t find you,” she says. “Why, you are shivering! It’s so cold here. Let’s get out.”</p>

    <p>In a few moments you and Jane are safely outside in the warm sunlight. Michael is waiting to greet you. Your visit with them lasts longer than you expected, because you have to spend the next week in bed with pneumonia.</p>

    <p>“If it weren’t for antibiotics,” your doctor tells you, “you would be remembered in this town as another victim of the curse of Chimney Rock.”</p>
