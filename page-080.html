    <p>You leave the room and race down the stairs. You find Michael in the study standing next to a policeman. They have just started to search the house.</p>

    <p>“I’m glad you’re here,” you say. “Come upstairs. It must be Mrs. Bigley. She says she is dying!”</p>

    <p>The three of you run up the stairs, and you lead them to the bedroom where you just left Mrs. Bigley.</p>

    <p>The policeman goes in first. “What kind of monkey business is this?” he cries.</p>

    <p>You look on the floor and rub your eyes with disbelief. Mrs. Bigley is nowhere to be seen. Instead, lying on the rug—exactly where Mrs. Bigley was—is a cat, the same one you were chasing a few minutes before.</p>

    <p>The policeman becomes angry. He accuses you of playing a joke on him. He tells you to wait in the hall with Michael while he searches the upstairs. A few minutes later he returns, having found no sign of either Mrs. Bigley or Jane.</p>

    <p>The policeman takes you back to the station house, where you are charged with malicious mischief. These charges are eventually dropped. The police, however, have a much bigger case on their hands. Jane has completely disappeared.</p>
