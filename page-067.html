    <p>Somehow you feel the policeman will be no match for Mrs. Bigley. You head upstairs, determined to look in every room and closet in the house, if necessary, to find Jane.</p>

    <p>At the top of the stairs, you hear a tinkly musical sound coming from a room down the hall. You walk very quietly to the door, which is slightly ajar, in time to see a large black cat jump down from the keys of a piano. So this is Melissa! The cat runs toward you. As it comes out the door you pick it up and hold it tightly.</p>

    <p>“I know you can help me find Jane,” you say impulsively.</p>

    <p>You don’t quite know why you say these words, but somehow you feel that the cat understands. You take off your belt and make a leash out of it. The cat squirms. It looks up at you with hatred in its eyes. Holding the end of your belt lightly, you drop the cat on the floor.</p>

    <p>“Take me to Jane,” you say.</p>

    <p>The cat starts rapidly down the hall and then turns into a long corridor leading to another wing of the house as if it knows exactly where it is going.</p>

    <p>Finally, it stops in front of a closed door. You turn the handle of the door. It is unlocked. You slowly open the door and look into a small bedroom. It obviously has not been used for a long time. The shade has fallen from the window, and paint is peeling off the walls. The room is empty except for an old-fashioned brass bed frame. Cringing in a corner, shivering, with no place to run or hide, is a mouse, which looks up at you helplessly.</p>

    <p>The cat shows no interest in the mouse; instead, it stares at you—its green eyes burning. You feel as though you must get away from the cat, and you drop the leash and run from the room, slamming the door behind you. You run down the stairs, where you find Lena, trembling with fear.</p>

    <p>“Where are Michael and the policeman?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“I&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. I don’t know,” she replies softly. “They disappeared. I can’t say where, or it will be the end of me.”
She collapses into a chair and begins to cry uncontrollably. You want to comfort her, but you are angry that you let the cat go. Then, suddenly, you see it again, moving slowly toward you.</p>
