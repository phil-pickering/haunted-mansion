    <p>You open the window and call as loudly as you can, “JANE!”</p>
    
    <p>The only response is the squeaking of the mouse.</p>

    <p>Then you hear a raspy voice calling, “Who are you? What do you mean breaking into my house?”</p>

    <p>You vault into the room, open the door, and run to the hall. There you encounter a tall elderly woman, who stands glaring at you with burning green eyes—Mrs. Bigley! But, a moment later she seems to vanish right in front of you! Confused and upset, but determined to find Jane, you continue on into the darkened hallway. As you stop to let your eyes adjust, you hear a shaky, quivering voice calling in the darkness, again and again, “Help me. Set me free.”</p>

    <p>You stand, frozen, listening, while the voice continues, “Walk toward me. Touch my hand. Free me!”</p>

    <p>As you walk toward the voice, you feel as if you are walking in a fog. You can only see a few feet in front of you. Suddenly there appears before you an outstretched hand, pale white—its long bony fingers extended toward you. You hesitate, but the hand lunges forward and seizes your own hand in a cold, clammy grip.</p>
