    <p>You try to lift up the window. It is jammed, and you cannot budge it. The meowing comes closer. You try the next window and, with great effort, open it. It is a long jump down to the roof, but you are sure you can make it. You climb out on the sill and get ready to spring, gauging your distance carefully, thinking how you will land.</p>

    <p>You glance back and see, perched on the railing at the top of the stairs, the black cat, its green eyes staring at you with an intensity you have never sensed before. Through its eyes, some great evil seems revealed to you.</p>

    <p>You jump, but you land off balance. The pitch of the roof is steeper than you realized. You can’t stop yourself from falling—all the way.</p>

    <p>A few hours later, two policemen find your body. They look at each other, and shake their heads. Speaking at the same time, they say the same thing—“It’s the curse of Chimney Rock.”</p>
