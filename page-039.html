    <p>Jervis leads you to the door, muttering and shaking his head. He unlocks and opens it. As you step inside, he shrinks back, as if afraid to enter. Although you are scared to be alone in the house yourself, you are just as glad not to have Jervis along.</p>

    <p>You walk through the huge kitchen, kicking pieces of the broken tile floor aside, and then through the dining room, with its long oak table and high-backed chairs. You call for Jane as you walk into the elegantly furnished library, where you see before you, standing in the middle of the oriental rug, a large black cat that stares up at you with intense, green eyes. It must be Melissa.</p>

    <p>The cat starts pacing back and forth. It runs into the front hall and then comes back to the doorway and peers up at you as if it wants you to follow.</p>

    <p>You follow the cat through the front hall and past the main staircase. Suddenly, you see someone or something in the shadows. You are tempted to investigate, but you don’t want to lose track of Melissa.</p>

    <p>Perhaps you only <em>imagined</em> you saw someone.</p>
