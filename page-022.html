    <p>You cross the meadow to the cottage and knock loudly on the door.</p>

    <p>In a moment a heavyset man wearing a dirty plaid shirt opens the door. His face is pale and fat. His eyes are pink, like a pig’s. Behind him is a huge dog—a mastiff—chained to a radiator. The dog growls menacingly, but does not move.</p>

    <p>“What do you want?” Jervis asks gruffly.</p>
    
    <p>“My cousin Jane is trapped in the house and I’m worried about her. Would you please unlock it and help me find her?”</p>

    <p>“She should not be in there. Even I don’t set foot in that house,” Jervis says.</p>

    <p>“Why not?” you ask.</p>

    <p>“The mistress would put me away.”</p>

    <p>“You mean you just take care of the grounds?”</p>

    <p>“Aye, and bring them food and things.”</p>

    <p>“But who takes care of the house?”</p>

    <p>“It’s taken care of all right, and so is anybody who goes inside. That’s why I’ll let you in, if you want.”</p>
