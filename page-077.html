  <main>

    <p>You run back to your cousins’ house. Finding no one at home, you pick up the phone and call the police.</p>

    <p>The officer on duty tells you that Michael came to the police station on his bike and asked for help—and that one of the men on patrol picked him up and went out to Chimney Rock.</p>

    <p>“They left only a few minutes ago,” he calls after you as you run out the door.</p>

    <p>You borrow Jane’s bike and ride back to Chimney Rock as fast as you can. There is a police car parked in the driveway. You go running up to the back door, expecting it to be open. Instead, you find it locked. You soon discover that all the other doors are locked, too. You pound on the doors and yell through the windows, but there is no sign of life.</p>

    <p>You are about to go to the nearest house and call the police station again when suddenly Michael and Jane come running up!</p>

    <p>“Where is the policeman?” Michael asks.</p>

    <p>“That’s what I was going to ask you!” you reply.</p>

    <p>You soon find that, although Jane and Michael escaped through a broken window, the policeman has disappeared—another victim of the witch’s curse of Chimney Rock.</p>
