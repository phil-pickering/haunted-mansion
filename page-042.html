    <p>You raise the window all the way, and climb in. The mouse shivers in the corner. As you stand looking at it, you notice something moving to the left of you. It is a large black cat. Its shoulders are hunched and its head is low as it stalks the mouse. Then, angered by your intrusion, it leaps aside, arching its back and hissing at you.</p>

    <p>The cat turns; you grab for it, and your hands come down on its tail. You hold it a moment, but it slips away and runs into an open cupboard. When you look in, you see it is actually a tiny passageway.</p>

    <p>You run around the corner and down the hall. Ahead of you is an open bedroom door. You walk into it and are startled to see—lying on a rug—a thin, tall, elderly woman, dressed in a long black dress. Her hair is reddish-white, and her face is pale white. She is clutching at her chest with her thin bony hands. She stares at you with burning green eyes as you approach.</p>

    <p>“I’m dying,” she cries. “It’s too much for my heart. Too much&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. <em>but you will be next. I’ll see to that!</em>”</p>
