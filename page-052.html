    <p>As you search the cellar, you see a door with a hole in it, large enough for a cat to go through. You turn the knob and cautiously unbolt the door and open it. Shining your flashlight all around, you are amazed to see before you a cave filled with mummies and skeletons, adorned with shining jewels. You begin to understand the full horror of the witch’s curse. Can you escape before you become her next victim?</p>

    <p>You turn back in the direction from which you came. There, standing before you, is a tall woman with long bony arms. Her hands are outstretched toward you. You are struck with horror as you observe that her fingers are long steely claws.</p>
