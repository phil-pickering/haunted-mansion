    <p>“You have no power over me,” you cry. “Look me in the eye and tell me—<em>where is my cousin Jane?</em>”</p>

    <p>“You’ve ruined everything!” Mrs. Bigley cries.</p>

    <p>“Bring Jane back!” you insist.</p>

    <p>“Very well,” Mrs. Bigley says, her voice brittle with anger. “I can’t have her. I have no life left—no life of any kind. <em>You</em> can have her!”</p>

    <p>Her green eyes shut tightly. Her face reddens and then turns very pale.</p>

    <p>Suddenly, you hear a girl’s voice crying. “Help—where am I?”</p>

    <p>You run into the hall and almost crash into Jane. She is overjoyed to find you. The two of you rush downstairs where you meet Michael and a policeman.</p>

    <p>When he hears your story, the policeman runs upstairs. He returns a few moments later, his face taut, his voice shaking as he speaks. “Mrs. Bigley is dead. You three should never have come into this house. You probably frightened her so much that it brought on a heart attack. I should have you booked on half a dozen counts, but I think you’ve all learned your lesson.”</p>

    <p>Jane says she feels ill, and the policeman drives her home. She recovers in a few days, but she is unable to remember what happened to her in Chimney Rock.</p>

    <p>Next time you come to visit your cousins, you find the house has been torn down. The new owners plan to build an apartment building on the property, and Jervis has moved away.</p>

    <p>“Funny thing,” Michael tells you, “they never found Mrs. Bigley’s cat.”</p>
