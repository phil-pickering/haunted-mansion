    <p>Next morning, with a suitcase in one hand and a cat carrier in the other, you thank your cousins and bid them good-by.</p>

    <p>A couple of weeks later you get a most amazing letter from Gilliam Prem. It says that Mrs. Bigley’s will provided that, if the cat chose a new owner who was willing to keep it, that person would become the owner of the cat—and of Chimney Rock! Because you kept Melissa, you are the new owner of Chimney Rock. Because the curse is ended, it’s worth about a quarter of a million dollars, and so are you!</p>
