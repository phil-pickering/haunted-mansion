    <p>You enter the room and walk toward Melissa. She continues to stare at you intently, as if she could read your mind. She is clearly not an ordinary cat; she seems like a creature in a dream.</p>

    <p>As you get closer to her, she opens her mouth, as if to laugh. Suddenly, she leaps off the piano and patters toward the door you just entered. She stops and stares intently at you again, as if daring you to pick her up.</p>
